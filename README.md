# Fake-Job-Detector

**Using Supervised ML Classifiers to Identify Fake Job Postings**

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/kernels

In this project I train and evaluate several supervised learning classifier models to predict false job postings in a dataset of ~18k postings. The results of my experiments and performance metrics are are captured in the ppt presentation.
